# Godot Game Template (***In Progress***)

*Made with Godot 4.2*

#### Includes: 
- Player
  
  > Basic movement state machine with idle, moving, jumping, and falling states
  > already setup.
  
- State Machine
  
  > Basic finite state machine for managing anything with single active states.
  > (e.g. player, enemy, crops, etc.)
  
- Save &amp; Load System
  
  > Uses encrypted binary serialization to provide security, a smaller save file,
  > and a custom save structure. This system is highly customizable for more
  > complex projects. Also contains methods for saving and loading user
  > preferences (controls, volume, etc.).
  
- Scene Manager
  
  > A simple scene manager to provide additional utilites such as a loading screen
  > and simple pause and resume functions to abstract and simplify basic processes.

- Basic Menus
  > Simple main menu, loading screen, and settings menu. They are purely functional
  > and will require sprucing up. They have built in scene changes and buttons for
  > necessary interaction. The settings menu interfaces with necessary systems
  > and can update and save user preferences.

This template is just to get a new project up and running, most of the systems will need to be changed to suit a new project.
