# 2D Platformer Template
_________________________

Includes: player, state machine, save &amp; load system, scene manager, and file structure

This template is just to get a new project up and running, most of the systems will need to be changed to suit a new project.
Please reference the docs to see how to safely change or remove systems.

It's far from perfect (I myself am still learning), so if you have any suggestions or advice feel free to let me know.
